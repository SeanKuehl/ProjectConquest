# ProjectConquest
This is a new, original card game I'm developing inspired by many TCGs/CCGs.
Made with the Godot game engine. The game is still under active development. 
If you would like to contribute, if you've found a bug,
want to learn how to play or most other concerns please see the "ProjectInformation"
folder for guidance on how to do just that. If there's something you need help with
that isn't in this documentation feel free to contact me through the Discord.
