attributes:

mechanical(grey, gold)
beast(brown, green)
mystic(magic)(pink and blue)
deviant(black, purple)
inferno(red, orange)
divine(white, yellow)

normal(not really a type, a non type)(white, teal)

call them monster cards, location cards, battle cards, strategy cards

monster cards have attacks and these attacks can have effects(on top of their damage), this means 
monster cards have custom scripts, even if they have no effect connected to their attack, they will still
use the script for their attack(attribute of attack and attack power)


monster attack(effect) -> location card(attackHappened signal) -> actual attack
(battle card effects happen seperatly)
what if a location/acive battle card corrects an attacks attribute and then the next one corrects
the correction to something else? should this happen or should this be avoided?

this won't happen, battle cards are only the "active" thing because they'll have to undo their effects after the battle
and maybe if the monster keeps a copy of it's original information I don't have to do that
so there is no conflict, the card would swap attributes once and from there on it would only go through the location card

in fact, use that system. Keep a list of the cards played during a battle, but also have monster cards keep a "battleversion"
of their things that they will use in battle in case they are manipulated by effects

when you select a monster while it is in a battle UI options will come up to show you your attack options
and you'll have the option to select one or skip your attack

battles have phases:
attack phase(choose a monster attack)(one attack per turn unless location card overrides it etc)
battle card phase(choose a battle card to play)(one battle card per turn unless location card overrides it etc)
