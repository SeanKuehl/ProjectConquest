If you have found a bug, please make a post in GitHub Discussions-> Bugs -> Bug Reports. In your post please provide: clear and specific steps on how to reliably reproduce the bug(a bug we can’t reproduce is a bug we can’t fix), similar bugs that are different from your bug and how they are different(this may not apply to all bugs, but at least make sure your bug hasn’t already been reported), machine information(what operating system you’re using,what OS version, what version of Project Conquest are you using, what brand of processor/graphics are you using, any other information that you think might be relevant), if possible/applicable please provide screenshots of either the bug or any errors that pop up when you reproduce it.
