If you would like to suggest a new feature, please make a post in GitHub Discussions -> Feature Proposals. If a maintainer is looking to promote your proposal into an Issue(a work item for the maintainers) they may ask you some questions about it. In your post please be as specific as possible with what your proposal is, other methods/version of the feature you’ve thought of that might also be viable, why/how this proposal is important to the project.
